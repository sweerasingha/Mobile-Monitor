## Taking Action on Your Privacy

### If You Have High Risk Apps

**Don't panic!** Many popular apps (like social media or messaging apps) are high risk because they need to access your camera, contacts, etc. to work properly.

**What to do:**
1. **Review each high-risk app individually**
2. **Ask yourself:** "Do I really use all the features this app offers?"
3. **Check your phone's settings** to see if you can turn off permissions you don't need
4. **Consider alternatives** if you're uncomfortable with an app's access

### Managing App Permissions (General Guide)

#### **On Android:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí [App Name] ‚Üí Permissions
2. Toggle off permissions you don't want to grant
3. Some apps may not work properly with reduced permissions

#### **On iPhone:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí [Permission Type]
2. Toggle off apps you don't want to have that access
3. Or go to Settings ‚Üí [App Name] to manage all permissions for that app

### When to Remove an App

Consider removing an app if:
- ‚ùå You haven't used it in months
- ‚ùå It asks for permissions that seem unnecessary
- ‚ùå You don't trust the app developer
- ‚ùå It's using excessive amounts of data
- ‚ùå You have privacy concerns and there are good alternatives

### Understanding Data Usage

### What the Numbers Mean

When you see data usage like "150 MB":
- **MB = Megabytes** (smaller amount)
- **GB = Gigabytes** (1 GB = 1,000 MB, larger amount)

### Visual Progress Bars

In the Recent Apps section, you'll see **blue progress bars** next to each app:
- **Full bar (100%)** = The app that uses the most data among your recent apps
- **Partial bar (50%)** = App uses half as much data as the highest-consuming app  
- **Empty bar (0%)** = App has used no data recently

**This helps you quickly see:**
- Which apps are your biggest data users
- How apps compare to each other
- Which apps might be using unexpected amounts of data

### Data Usage Breakdown

**M: 50 MB** - Mobile data (uses your phone plan)
**W: 100 MB** - WiFi data (uses your home/office internet)

**Why this matters:**
- High mobile data usage might increase your phone bill
- Some apps use more data than others
- You can see which apps are "data hungry"
- Progress bars help you quickly spot heavy data users

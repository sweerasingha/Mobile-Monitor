# Mobile Monitor - Production Ready

A comprehensive React Native application for monitoring mobile app security, permissions, and usage patterns.

## ‚úÖ Production Status

- **Real data validation**: Comprehensive data validation and sanitization
- **Error handling**: Production-grade error boundaries and fallbacks  
- **Service monitoring**: Built-in service health monitoring
- **Platform-ready**: Requires native module implementation for full functionality

## üöÄ Quick Start

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide.

### Prerequisites for Production
- **Native Module Required**: Custom implementation of `InstalledApps` module
- **System Permissions**: Platform-specific app monitoring permissions
- **See**: [Production Deployment Guide](./PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for details

### Development Setup

1. **Start Metro**:
```bash
npm start
# OR
yarn start
```

2. **Run the application**:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

## üîß Current Functionality

### ‚úÖ Available Features (No Native Module Required)
- **Permission Analysis**: Security risk assessment of app permissions
- **App Categorization**: Automatic categorization of applications  
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive security risk evaluation
- **Service Status**: Built-in monitoring and diagnostic tools
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when features unavailable

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Native Implementation
- **App List Retrieval**: Requires native `InstalledApps` module
- **App Details**: Detailed app information from system
- **Usage Statistics**: App usage time and patterns
- **Data Usage Monitoring**: Network usage tracking (future feature)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Background monitoring (future feature)

## üì± What to Expect

- Full app monitoring functionality
- Real app data from device
- Complete security analysis
- All features operational

## üìñ Documentation

- **[Production Deployment Guide](./PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)**: Complete production setup
- **[Technical Documentation](./TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md)**: Architecture and implementation
- **[Complete Documentation](./COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md)**: Comprehensive feature guide
- **[User Guide](./USER_GUIDE.md)**: End-user functionality guide

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Testing Production Build
```bash
# Test without native modules (should handle gracefully)
npm run android --variant=release

# View service status in app
# Navigate to: Settings > Service Status (when implemented in navigation)
```

### Adding Native Modules
See [Production Deployment Guide](./PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for native module implementation requirements.

## üîê Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All analysis performed on-device
- **No External APIs**: Permission analysis uses local database
- **User Control**: No data transmitted without explicit consent
- **Privacy First**: Minimal data collection, maximum user control

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
